# Availity Fullstack Homework Assignment

### Questions:

1. Tell me your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.
   
    My proudest professional achievement would be the UX design process overhaul that I lead. At my current job
    the UI development teams are expected to perform UX design before implementing UIs. This usually involved quick
    wireframing without much customer interaction. As part of the effort I lead, the process was overhauled to
    be a multi-step process involving the gaining of a better understanding of the day-to-day needs and pains of our
    users through direct customer interaction to get feedback on the designs. This has led to better defined features, 
    a higher quality product, and much more confidence that what the team is building is exactly what the customer 
    wants.

2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)

    A book that I've read recently that I would recommend is "Bubble or Revolution?" by Neel Mehta, Adi Agashe, and 
    Parth Detroja. This book gives a great overview of both the computer science and the economics behind cryptocurrencies
    and blockchains. It goes over how currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum work and why the ways they work make them
    so valuable. It also covers the topic of blockchain as a whole and talks about some of the projects being tackled by
    blockchain based startups as well as the ways that blockchains are being used in large corporations to optimize some
    of their existing processes. All in all, this is a great book to get a comprehensive overview of these technologies
    that could very potentially have a huge impact on tech as a whole.

3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?

    Availity is a company that connects doctors with insurance companies in order to make it easy to exchange information. 
    They make it so that doctors more easily get the information they need so they can better focus on taking care of their
    patients and get paid more quickly. As an example, when you go to the doctor to get a check up, the doctor has to give
    information to your insurance so that they can get paid, and Availity simplifies this process.
